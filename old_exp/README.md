# Scene Localization for Matching UAV Images with Satellite Images

This directory contains theory and experimental results on 
geolocalization dataset. The objective is to find a well suited 
method for matching UAV images with satellite images in order
to predict the location of the UAV in a GPS-denied environment.

The following two methods have been tested so far:
1. SIFT based matching
2. Image matching with Dual AlexNet structure
